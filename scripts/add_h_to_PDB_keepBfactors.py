# this script adds hydrogens to a PDB file while also transferring the beta factors from the initial file to the new file.
# there's a very simple way to add hydrogens, but usually you lose the b factors. a quirt here is that the input script (usually)
# has distances in angstroms, and the output of this has distances in nanometers - be aware.
# this script exists because AF output doesn't have hydrogens, and they need to be added because ultimately i'm going to be
# extracting features from the PDB so all atoms need to be included.
# oh yes, and also recall that the b factors aren't really b factors, they're the pLDDT (which i want to use later).
